# RAG-Based LLM for Legal Applications
This repository contains a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) implementation designed to assist in legal queries and tasks using large language models (LLMs). The project integrates LLMs with retrieval systems, enabling efficient and accurate responses tailored to the legal domain.

## Features
RAG Implementation: Combines a retrieval system with generative models for better context-aware responses.
LLaMA 3.2 3B: A state-of-the-art open-source language model for generating high-quality responses based on legal queries.
FAISS Integration: Enables fast and scalable vector search for relevant legal documents.
Legal Knowledge Base: Utilizes a domain-specific corpus to provide accurate legal information.
